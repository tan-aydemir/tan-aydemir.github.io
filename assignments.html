            <h2>Assignment 5 - Predicting Customer Churn Using KNN</h2>
            <p>a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave the bank) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Customer churn is a significant problem in the banking industry, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, banks can take proactive steps to improve customer retention.</p>
